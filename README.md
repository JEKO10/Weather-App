## Project task

My first ever project pushed to GitHub and one of my first projects created using React. In this project, I learned how to use the useState hook and how to fetch data from API.

## Project overview

This web app pulls data from OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a page. It displays basic info like weather, temperature, sunrise, and sunset. I created a search bar for browsing places all around the world. It also has the current date and you can choose between 3 temperature units: Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.

## Built with
