## Project task

My first ever project pushed to GitHub and one of my first projects created using React. In this project, I learned how to use useState hook and how to fetch data from API.

## Project overview

This web app pulls data from Openweathermap API and displays it on page. It displays basic info like weather, temperature, sunrise and sunset. I created search bar for browsing places all around the world. It also has current date and you can choose between 3 temperature units: Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit.
